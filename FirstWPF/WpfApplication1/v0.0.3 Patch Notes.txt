MIG ICA 1 Resubmission (v0.0.3) Patch Notes:

BUG FIXES

- Fixed a bug that would cause client to crash when attempting to save a loaded file

- Fixed a bug that would cause maps to duplicate when saving after clearing and loading a map

ADDITIONS

- The Window can now only be stretched vertically not horizontally, this is to prevent map distortion

- There is now an Undo button to go back on your changes

- Program now more accurately detects when changes have been made without saving and only prompts you at
  those times to save.
