MIG ICA 1 Resubmission (v0.0.2) Patch Notes:

BUG FIXES

- Fixed an issue whereby attempting to load an xml file and cancelling would cause a NullReferenceException error

- Fixed a bug where you couldn't import a new tileset after starting a new project


ADDITIONS

- Program now prompts the user to save their current project if it detects that any changes have been made
  while the user attempts to start a new project or load an existing one

- The Editor no longer prompts you to load a map, only to tell you at the end that the corresponding tile set
  should have been loaded in the first place. Appropriate checks and warnings are now in place to tell you if
  anything could go wrong with an action you are about to take.

- Added a menu for map management, with the ability to load a map by itself, or clear the current map.
