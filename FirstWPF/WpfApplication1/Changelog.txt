CHANGELOG

06/07/15:

- set isSaved in "//Open document" to false so that the new button would still work on newly loaded projects,
  this will remain a problem as newly loaded projects do not need to be saved before closing or replacing as
  no changes have been made to them. Either find a way to create project files or load everything in a new window.

07/07/15:

- Changed the whole load/save system, adding a new menu for map specific management. No longer will the editor
  prompt you to load a file only to tell you at the end that a corresponding tile set should have been loaded
  first. The appropriate checks will be made while carrying out any action in the editor.

TODO

- Change File menu file handling to handle projects, as other menus have now been put in place for specifics,
  such as map and tile set management.

- Add more Comments

08/08/15:

- Put all base tile functions within a Tile class, including tile data such as tile height, rows and colums for
  splitting the bitmap

- Loading a map now properly populates the tileIndex, this gets rid of the outOfRange exception error I was
  getting when attempting to save a loaded map that I added tiles to

- The "tileIndex and mapImages" list and collection now properly clear themselves when told to do so, fixing
  the problem that was duplicating maps upon loading onto a cleared window and saving, due to the fact that
  even thought the window was clear the index was still holding values, overpopulating itself when saving.

- Added an Undo function

- Cleaned up client menu
